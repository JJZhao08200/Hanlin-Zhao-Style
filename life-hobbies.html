                    <p>Mountains stand, waters run.</p>
                    <p>In 2024 I climbed Abuji Tso in Yunnan, China, at an altitude of 4,400 metres. This was my second high altitude trek. In the future, I will continue to challenge myself and my next goal is Haba Snow Mountain at 5300 metres.</p>

                    <h3>🌍 Road Trip 🚗</h3>
                    <p>Wander where the wind blows.</p>
                    <p>In 2024, my total road trip mileage was about 15,000 kilometres. I travelled the west coast of the US (Vancouver-San Francisco-Los Angeles-San Diego-Las Vegas-Vancouver). In addition, I drove about 4,000 kilometres in Yunnan, China in order to taste different Pu'er teas. I have some other short trips (within 1000km). in 2025, my goal is to drive to Tuktoyaktuk in the north of Canada, in the middle of the Arctic Circle. I also plan to drive the middle of the USA.</p>
                    <p>2025 in progress... This year I changed my plan but Tuktoyaktuk is still my dream. It is such a busy year. My graduate program is too busy! In my I went back to west of US from San Francisco to Las Vegas then turn north to Yellowstone National Park. I visited 9 national parks and Salt Lake City. In the next half year. I may have another road trip to be decide.</p>

                    <p>Normally I go up to the mountains for off-roading, and the place I go to most often is Stave-lake on the east side of Vancouver, which is one of the most popular off-roading spots in Vancouver in the spring or winter.</p>
