                    <p>Mountains stand, waters run.</p>
                    <p>In 2024 I climbed Abuji Tso in Yunnan, China, at an altitude of 4,400 metres. This was my second high altitude trek. In the future, I will continue to challenge myself and my next goal is Haba Snow Mountain at 5300 metres.</p>

                    <p>Wander where the wind blows.</p>
                    <p>In 2024, my total road trip mileage was about 15,000 kilometres. I travelled the west coast of the US (Vancouver-San Francisco-Los Angeles-San Diego-Las Vegas-Vancouver). In addition, I drove about 4,000 kilometres in Yunnan, China in order to taste different Pu'er teas. I have some other short trips (within 1000km). in 2025, my goal is to drive to Tuktoyaktuk in the north of Canada, in the middle of the Arctic Circle. I also plan to drive the middle of the USA.</p>

                    <p>I'm the guitarist in the band and I've written a lot of songs. But I'm very busy right now and I'm writing very slowly. I can sing for you to listen.</p>

                    <p>On weekends I practice 10m air rifle and competitive recurve bow, and I'm very good at shooting sports (or at least the best among my friends). But I recently injured my shoulder and I need a break.</p>

                    <p>Normally I go up to the mountains for off-roading, and the place I go to most often is Stave-lake on the east side of Vancouver, which is one of the most popular off-roading spots in Vancouver in the spring or winter.</p>
