            <p>In 2024, my total road trip mileage was about 15,000 kilometres. I travelled the west coast of the US (Vancouver-San Francisco-Los Angeles-San Diego-Las Vegas-Vancouver). In addition, I drove about 4,000 kilometres in Yunnan, China in order to taste different Pu'er teas. I have some other short trips (within 1000km). in 2025, my goal is to drive to Tuktoyaktuk in the north of Canada, in the middle of the Arctic Circle. I also plan to drive the middle of the USA.</p>

            <p>2025 end. This year I changed my plan but Tuktoyaktuk is still my dream. It is such a busy year. My graduate program is too busy! In my I went back to west of US from San Francisco to Las Vegas then turn north to Yellowstone National Park. I visited 9 national parks and Salt Lake City. In the next half year. Driving the Tang Poetry Road from Hangzhou to Wenzhou, I found myself inside Li Bai’s line—“天姥连天向天横，势拔五岳掩赤城.” Some landscapes are not meant to be seen, but to be understood.</p>
