        <p>
          We successfully integrated the YouTube Analytics API to retrieve key metrics such as views,
          subscriber growth, audience distribution, and traffic sources, while resolving OAuth authentication
          challenges to ensure secure data access.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the API only allows access to our own channel data, we leveraged YouTube Data API v3 for public
          statistics and applied Machine Learning models, including time series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM), to
          predict future trends.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, we integrated Looker Studio to create real-time dashboards for visualizing YouTube
          performance, enhancing insights through interactive and data-driven reporting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moving forward, we aim to refine our ML models, automate data collection, and build an intelligent
          analytics system that seamlessly combines API data, predictive modeling, and visualization for optimized
          YouTube growth strategies.

        <p>
          Over two days, I worked with an incredible team to tackle a real-world project finance challenge—structuring
          the financing strategy for Deep Sky, a large-scale Direct Air Capture (DAC) facility in Québec.
        </p>

        <p>✔️ Climate Finance &amp; Offtake Agreements – Explored sustainability-linked bonds, debt structuring, and revenue stability.</p>
        <p>✔️ Carbon Markets &amp; Risk Management – Assessed the feasibility of carbon credit pricing, voluntary/compliance markets, and offtake strategies.</p>
        <p>✔️ Financial Modeling &amp; Investment Structuring – Evaluated project bankability, DSCR, and equity/debt allocation to optimize returns.</p>

        <p>
          This experience deepened my understanding of sustainable finance, project structuring, and carbon markets,
          reinforcing the role of finance in accelerating climate innovation. Grateful for the insights from industry experts
          and my teammates!

        <p>
          During the recent Learning Analytics Hackathon, I participated as part of Team HAX, where we won the
          <strong>"Most Relevant to Teaching and Learning"</strong> award. Our project aimed to promote meaningful discussions
          aligned with learning outcomes while reducing the number of disengaged or "spam" posts in online learning environments.
          We proposed dashboards for both instructors and students to track engagement and ensure that discussions contributed to
          the intended learning objectives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout the process, I applied various technical skills, including Python, Tableau, data analysis, and web design,
          which were instrumental in creating the dashboards and analyzing data to provide actionable insights. These combined
          efforts led to a solution that enhanced the overall learning experience and contributed to our success in the competition.
